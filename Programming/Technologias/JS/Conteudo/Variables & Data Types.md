# Variables

## Var
+ outdated - Has existed since the primordial days of JS and now there are better options
+ globally scoped - if a var is created inside a function or code block and another is created outside with the same there will be a conflict.
## Let
+ can be modified after being declared
## Const
+ can NOT be modified after being declared 

# Data Types

## String
```js
const name = 'jhon doe'

// concatenação
const age = 30

const x = 10;
//if declare
const color = x == 10 ? 'red' : 'blue';

console.log('my name is '+ name +' and i am'+ age)

console.log(`my name is ${name} and i am ${age}`)
```

```js
const age = 30;
```
## Bool
```js
const isTrue = false;
```
## Float
