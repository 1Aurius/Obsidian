# Hello
My name is Pedro √Årias. I don't aspire to anything and wish only to live to see something else, never for me to fall into the self-destructive thoughts for those surround me in my awake hours. i fear more then i can think and think more then i should. Can't stress enough that i am alive, therefore i do as i please and i must please those who are "above". i have no god to come and take away my hunger, nor do i have a light to look out for, never for me to run blindly behind a concept until the sweet release of death. Never for me to laugh and not wonder why. Never for me to not hate the hairless-monkeys next to me. Never for me to scream, for i have no mouth. I have nothing, i am nothing and this vessel likes to make me think otherwise.
