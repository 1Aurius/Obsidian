after you have done your research, you need to have your message ready to lay out.
### focal points
in your design you are going to need a main "object" in your screen, either a text or some [[tylography]] that covers a wide area of the screen. A good focal point will be responsible for hooking the user. This should be the start of your user's attention journey. 

## Direction
You will want to direct the user's attention around the screen with the flow system .

## Repetition
this is pretty obvious but it really just means to repeat assets and colours around your designs to make isolated parts feel connected.
